# Question: How do you calculate the total surface area of a 3D shape represented in a 2D grid? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `surfaceArea` calculates the total surface area of a 3D shape represented in a 2D grid. The function iterates over each cell in the grid, and if the cell value is greater than zero, it calculates the surface area of the cell by multiplying the cell value by 4 (representing the four sides of the 3D shape) and adding 2 (representing the top and bottom faces of the 3D shape). The function then checks if there are cells adjacent to the current cell on the left and above, and if so, it subtracts the overlapping area from the total surface area. The overlapping area is calculated as the minimum value of the current cell and the adjacent cell multiplied by 2 (representing the two sides that overlap). The function then returns the total surface area, which is the sum of the surface areas of all cells in the grid. This solution effectively calculates the total surface area of a 3D shape represented in a 2D grid by accounting for the surface area of each cell and subtracting any overlapping areas.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution solves the problem in a similar way to the JavaScript version. The logic of the solution is the same, but the TypeScript version is implemented as a class, while the JavaScript version is implemented as a function.

In the TypeScript version, the 2D grid is stored as a property of the Grid class, and the method to calculate the surface area is a method of the Grid class. This allows for a more object-oriented approach, where the grid and the method to calculate its surface area are encapsulated in the same object.

The TypeScript version also uses type annotations to specify the types of variables and function return values. This can help catch type-related errors at compile time, and makes the code more self-documenting.

In terms of language features, the TypeScript version uses classes and type annotations, which are not available in JavaScript. However, the core logic of the solution, which involves nested loops and conditional statements, is the same in both versions.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version in terms of logic and structure. Both versions use a nested loop to iterate over the 2D grid, calculate the surface area of each cell, and subtract the overlapping area if there are adjacent cells. The total surface area is then returned.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of C++ and JavaScript:

1. In C++, the `vector` data structure is used to represent the 2D grid, while in JavaScript, an array of arrays is used.

2. The C++ version uses the `min` function from the standard library to find the minimum of two values, while the JavaScript version uses the `Math.min` method.

3. The C++ version includes a `main` function where the size of the grid and the grid values are read from the standard input, and the result is printed to the standard output. In contrast, the JavaScript version directly calls the `surfaceArea` function with hard-coded grid values and logs the result to the console.

4. In C++, the `&` symbol is used in the function parameter to pass the grid by reference, which means that the original grid can be modified inside the function. In JavaScript, arrays are always passed by reference, so there's no need for a special symbol.

5. The C++ version checks if a grid cell is non-zero with `if (grid[i][j])`, while the JavaScript version uses `if(cell > 0)`. Both of these are equivalent because non-zero values are truthy in both languages.

6. The C++ version uses `cin` and `cout` for input and output, while the JavaScript version uses `console.log` for output. The JavaScript version does not have any user input in this case.
